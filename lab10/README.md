# Lab 10: Socket Programming and Multi Threading

## Tasks

- Complete the server code for collecting the messages, and closing the connections properly.

## Description
This lab provides an example of one-way client to server messaging and
handling the parallel flow of incoming messages on the server side.

The students are expected to apply their knowledge of multi-threading and synchronization
